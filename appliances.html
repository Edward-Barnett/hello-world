    <h2>The toaster and I</h2>
    <p>Our toaster comes from Costco. It looked pretty good.</p>
    <p>Read the instructions. If you use it to heat Pop Tarts, you void the warranty.</p>
    <p>That is, if you use the toaster, the warranty's no good.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Like I'd want to make a warranty claim for this mangy toaster anyway. The piece of crap.
    </p>
    <p>Guess I should have just left it in the box.</p>
    <p>Rotten pience of junk. Wish I'd never bought it.</p>
    <p>I feel like I was pressured into it by the guy at Costco giving out samples of granola or whatever it was.</p>
    <p>Now I'm getting mad. Post Toastems, too, you can't heat those in this toaster without upsetting the balance of nature.</p>
    <p>Wish I'd never heard of this toaster.</p>
    <p>Can I toast a slice of bread, or is that also an offense?</p>  
    <p>Heartless bastards.</p>
    <p>I suppose they want my Social Security number, too.</p>
    <p>Fine, I'll just eat my bread cold.</p>
