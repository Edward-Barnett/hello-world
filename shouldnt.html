    <h2>The strange story of my toaster</h2>
    <p>We bought our toaster at Costco a couple of years ago, and I like it.</p>
    <p>But I read the instructions, and it states, explicitly, that using it to heat toaster pastries will void the warranty.</p>
    <p>I didn't have to think about this for very long. I can buy another toaster, but what's the point of having a toaster if I can't use
       it to heat Pop-Tarts?
