                    <h3>The Find</h3>
                    <section>
                        <p>Some years ago, I was digging around in the yard when... 
                            I found something buried at the foot of a tree. Not deep in the ground but it appeared to have been there for a 
                            long time. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I could scarecly believe my eyes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With haste that I would come to regret, I dug it out and cleaned it up.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so I discovered the mysterious object that would puzzle me for years.</p>
                        <section class="buttonable">
                        <div class="buttonable-text">
                            <div class="image-and-text">
                                <div class="image-area">
                                    <img class="phoneImg-uncropped leftimg" src="img/mysteryMan.png" alt="The Figure Stands">
                                </div>
                                <div class="text-area">
                                    <p>The object is about four inches high -- a more accurate measurement is not possible because I couldn't find a ruler.</p>
                                    <p>Of some hard, plastic-like material, I believe the original coloring has been affected by time spent in the ground. 
                                    Red coloring atop the figure's "head" is well-preserved under some transparent material. The overall impression is of a 
                                    man in a sort of protective suit.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I was able to satisfy myself that the object was manufactured, and not the mummified remains of a once 
                                        living creature.</p>
                                    <p>Presumably terrestrial, is it pre-Columbian? How can it be reliably dated?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The expression on the face is mysterious, somewhat mocking.</p>

                        <p>My first reaction to the object was curiosity. My second reaction was fear.</p>
                        <p>My third reaction was one of surprise. Surprise that I feared the object.</p>
                        <p>I came to realize that, every year since I found it, I became ill for a short period, usually in the winter.</p>
                        <p>Also one time I had to replace my car battery.</p>

                            On the objects posterior, some characters are stamped. They appear to be in English. But are they?

                    <section class='article-text buttonable-text'>
                       <p>A Google search later, I found a similar object for sale on eBay. It was some sort of toy astronaut.
                        </p>
                        <p>The one I have is badly discolored, having been in the dirt for so long, so I don't think
                             I can get much for it. Besides, I failed to unearth the original packaging.

                    <section class='article-text buttonable-text'>
                       <p>No child lived on these premises before we moved in. so I believe a dog stole the toy and 
                           buried it.
