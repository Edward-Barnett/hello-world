                    <h3>The Find</h3>
                    <section class='article-text'>
                        <p>Not a lot of years ago, I was digging around in the back yard when 
                            I found something buried near a ficus tree. Not deep in the ground but it appeared to have been there for a long time. With ill-advised 
                            haste, I dug it out and cleaned it up.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so I discovered the mysterious object that would puzzle me for years. If not longer...</p>
                        <div class="image-and-text">
                            <div class="image-area">
                                <img class="phoneImg-uncropped leftimg" src="img/mysteryMan.png" alt="The Figure Stands">
                            </div>
                            <div class="text-area">
                                <p>The object is about four inches high -- a more accurate measurement was not possible because I couldn't find a ruler.
                                It's of some hard, brittle material. I believe the original coloring has been affected by the time in the ground. 
                                Red coloring atop the figure's "head" is well-preserved under some transparent material. The overall impression is of a 
                                man in some sort of protective suit.  
                                </p>
                                <p>I was able to satisfy myself that this was a figurine, and not the mummified remains of a creature.</p>
                                <p>I am certain that its origin is terrestrial, but how old is it? Pre-Columbian? How to date it?
                                </p>
                                <p>The arms are on swivels, turning only at the shoulder, and can be
                                    turned in full-revolutions: this is not in imitation of how human arms turn. The legs do not bend. The figurine is
                                     balanced so that it will stand upright on its "feet", could this be for the benefit of worshipers?                                
                                </p>
                                <p>The expression on the face is mysterious.</p>
