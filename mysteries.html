                    <h3>The Find</h3>
                    <section>
                        <p>Not a lot of years ago, I was digging around at the side of our house when... 
                            I found something buried near the ficus tree. Not deep in the ground but it appeared to have been there for a long time. With ill-advised 
                            haste, I dug it out and cleaned it up.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so I discovered the mysterious object that would puzzle me for years. If not longer...</p>
                        <section class="buttonable">
                        <div class="buttonable-text">
                            <div class="image-and-text">
                                <div class="image-area">
                                    <img class="phoneImg-uncropped leftimg" src="img/mysteryMan.png" alt="The Figure Stands">
                                </div>
                                <div class="text-area">
                                    <p>The object is about four inches high -- a more accurate measurement is not possible because I couldn't find a ruler.
                                    Of some hard, brittle material, I believe the original coloring has been affected by time spent in the ground. 
                                    Red coloring atop the figure's "head" is well-preserved under some transparent material. The overall impression is of a 
                                    man in some sort of protective suit.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I was able to satisfy myself that the object was manufactured, and not the mummified remains of a once 
                                        living creature.</p>
                                    <p>Presumably terrestrial, how old is it? Pre-Columbian? How could it be reliably dated?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The arms are on swivels, turning only at the shoulder, and can be
                                        turned in full-revolutions: this is not in imitation of the motion of human arms. The legs do not bend. 
                                        The figurine is balanced so that it will stand upright on its "feet", possibly so that it can be worshiped.                                
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The expression on the face is mysterious... Mocking...</p>
