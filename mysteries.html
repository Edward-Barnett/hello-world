                    <h3>The Find</h3>
                    <section>
                        <p>Some years ago, I was digging around in the yard when... 
                            I found something buried near the ficus tree. Not deep in the ground but it appeared to have been there for a long time. With haste that I would soon regret, I dug it out and cleaned it up.
                        </p>
                        <p>And so I discovered the mysterious object that would puzzle me for several years.</p>
                        <section class="buttonable">
                        <div class="buttonable-text">
                            <div class="image-and-text">
                                <div class="image-area">
                                    <img class="phoneImg-uncropped leftimg" src="img/mysteryMan.png" alt="The Figure Stands">
                                </div>
                                <div class="text-area">
                                    <p>The object is about four inches high -- a more accurate measurement is not possible because I couldn't find a ruler.</p>
                                    <p>Of some hard, brittle material, I believe the original coloring has been affected by time spent in the ground. 
                                    Red coloring atop the figure's "head" is well-preserved under some transparent material. The overall impression is of a 
                                    man in some sort of protective suit.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I was able to satisfy myself that the object was manufactured, and not the mummified remains of a once 
                                        living creature.</p>
                                    <p>Presumably terrestrial, how old is it? Pre-Columbian? How could it be reliably dated?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>The expression on the face is mysterious... Mocking.</p>

                        <p>My first reaction to the object was curiosity. My second reaction was fear.</p>
                        <p>My third reaction was one of surprise. Surprise that I could fear the object.</p>
                        <p>I came to realize that, every year since I found it, I became ill for a short period, usually in the winter.</p>
                        <p>Also I had to replace my car battery.</p>

                            On the objects posterior, some characters are stamped. They appear to be in English.

                       <p>After a brief Google search I found a similar object for sale on eBay. It was some sort of toy astronaut.
                        </p>
                        <p>The one I have is badly discolored, having been in the dirt for so long, so I don't think
                             I can get much for it. Besides, I failed to unearth the original packaging.

                       <p>No child lived on these premises before we moved in. so I believe a dog stole the toy from a neighborhood kid and 
                           buried it.
                        </p>
                        <p>I feel bad for the kid.</p>
                        <p>If the toy was yours, contact me and I'll be sure to get it to you.
